## Introduction

This project aims to analyze the World Happiness Report dataset to gain insights into the factors influencing global happiness and well-being. The World Happiness Report is a landmark survey of the state of global happiness that ranks countries based on various factors such as GDP per capita, social support, life expectancy, freedom, and corruption.

The dataset used in this analysis contains information from multiple years and includes factors that contribute to happiness scores. By exploring and visualizing this data, we hope to understand the key determinants of happiness and how they have evolved over time.

## Objectives

The main objectives of this project are as follows:

1. **Data Exploration:** Perform an initial exploration of the dataset to understand its structure and contents. This includes checking for missing values, data types, and summary statistics.

2. **Temporal Analysis:** Conduct a temporal analysis to observe how happiness scores and contributing factors have changed over the years.

3. **Country Comparison:** Compare happiness scores and associated factors across different countries to identify patterns and variations.

4. **Correlation Analysis:** Explore the relationships between various factors and happiness scores to determine which factors have the strongest influence on happiness.

5. **Visualization:** Create visual representations such as plots, charts, and graphs to communicate the findings effectively.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis is sourced from the World Happiness Report and is available in a CSV format. It contains the following key columns:

- `Country`: The name of the country.
- `Year`: The year for which the happiness score is reported.
- `Happiness Score`: A numerical measure of happiness and well-being.
- `GDP per capita`: Gross Domestic Product per capita of the country.
- `Social Support`: Perceived social support within the country.
- `Life Expectancy`: Average life expectancy of the country's population.
- `Freedom`: The extent of freedom experienced by individuals in the country.
- `Corruption`: The perceived level of corruption in the country.

## Tools and Libraries

The analysis will be conducted using Python programming language and popular data science libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. These libraries provide powerful tools for data manipulation, visualization, and statistical analysis, enabling us to derive meaningful insights from the dataset.

## Conclusion

By analyzing the World Happiness Report dataset, we aim to uncover the factors that contribute to global happiness and how they have evolved over time. The findings from this analysis may provide valuable insights for policymakers and researchers in understanding the key determinants of happiness and well-being on a global scale.


# [2. Traffic Accident Analysis in the UK](https://github.com/saerosef/Traffic-Accident-Analysis/blob/main/UKTrafficAccidentsAnalysis.ipynb)

## Introduction

This project aims to conduct a comprehensive analysis of traffic accidents in the United Kingdom (UK) using the UK Traffic Accident dataset. Traffic accidents can have significant social, economic, and environmental impacts, and understanding the factors contributing to these accidents can aid in improving road safety and reducing accident rates.

The UK Traffic Accident dataset contains information about various attributes related to traffic accidents, including location, time, weather conditions, severity, and contributing factors. By analyzing this dataset, we aim to gain insights into the patterns and trends of traffic accidents, identify high-risk areas, and explore the key factors that lead to accidents.

## Objectives

The main objectives of this project are as follows:

1. **Data Exploration:** Perform an initial exploration of the UK Traffic Accident dataset to understand its structure and content. This involves checking for data quality, missing values, and relevant statistical summaries.

2. **Spatial Analysis:** Conduct a spatial analysis to visualize the distribution of traffic accidents across different regions of the UK. This will help identify areas with high accident rates and potential hotspots.

3. **Temporal Analysis:** Explore the temporal patterns of traffic accidents to understand if certain days, months, or times of the day are associated with higher accident rates.

4. **Weather Impact:** Investigate the influence of weather conditions on traffic accidents, examining how factors such as rain, fog, or snow may contribute to accident occurrences.

5. **Severity Analysis:** Analyze the severity of accidents and identify the primary factors contributing to more severe accidents.

6. **Contributing Factors:** Investigate the key contributing factors to traffic accidents, such as speeding, distracted driving, road conditions, and more.

7. **Predictive Modeling (Optional):** Build a predictive model to forecast accident occurrence or severity based on historical data and contributing factors.

## Dataset

The UK Traffic Accident dataset used in this analysis contains records of reported traffic accidents in the UK. The dataset includes the following key attributes:

- `Accident Index`: A unique identifier for each accident.
- `Location`: The geographical location (latitude and longitude) of the accident.
- `Date`: The date of the accident occurrence.
- `Time`: The time of day when the accident happened.
- `Weather Conditions`: Describes the weather at the time of the accident.
- `Road Surface Conditions`: The condition of the road surface during the accident.
- `Light Conditions`: The lighting conditions at the accident site.
- `Severity`: Indicates the severity of the accident (e.g., slight, serious, or fatal).
- `Accident Contributing Factors`: Factors contributing to the occurrence of the accident (e.g., speeding, alcohol, etc.).

## Tools and Libraries

The analysis will be performed using Python and various data science libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Geopandas. These libraries provide powerful tools for data manipulation, visualization, spatial analysis, and statistical modeling, enabling us to gain meaningful insights from the dataset.

## Conclusion

By conducting a thorough analysis of the UK Traffic Accident dataset, we aim to provide valuable insights into the patterns and contributing factors of traffic accidents in the UK. The findings from this analysis may contribute to the development of targeted interventions and strategies to improve road safety and reduce traffic accidents in the future.
